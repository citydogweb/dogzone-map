<!--
A fast and customizable solution for client side filtering of large arrays that ignores diacritics,
built with and for Polymer.

Main features:
- Token based and case-insensitive filtering
- Configurable matching method (`contains`, `startsWith` or `equals`)
- Support for large arrays without browser freeze
- Fully declarative usage with bindable filter query, source array and result array
- Configurable item properties and subproperties to asses
- Support for the 'Google-like' quote (") operator
- Custimozable logical 'OR' operator
- Stop-words support to ignore configured tokens
- Diacritics (accents and other character modifiers) support

Example:

    <poly-filter-diacritic
      filter="[[myFilterOrQueryToSearchFor]]"
      array-to-filter="[[myArrayToFilter]]"
      filtered-array="{{myArrayAfterItWasFiltered}}"
      stop-words="[[arrayOfWordsToIgnore]]"
      logical-or="or">
    </poly-filter-diacritic>

### Notes

If you are developing your own Polymer web-component with a filtering/searching functionality,
consider using the `poly-filter-diacritic-behavior` directly for maximum performances.

If you do not need to ignore accents (for example if you only deal with english language),
you should use `poly-filter` or `poly-filter-behavior` for maximum performances.
